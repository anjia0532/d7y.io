Installing Dragonfly Manager Server

This topic explains how to install the Dragonfly manager server.

## Prerequisites

When deploying with physical machines, the following conditions must be met.

| Required Software | Version Limit |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Git               | 1.9.1+        |
| Golang            | 1.16.x        |

## Procedure - When Deploying with Physical Machines

### Get manager executable file

1. Download a binary package of the manager. You can download
   one of the latest builds for Dragonfly on
   the [github releases page](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases).

   ```sh
   # latest version
   # version=$(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/version/version.latest)

   # stable version
   version=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/version/version.stable)

   wget -o Dragonfly2_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
      https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases/download/v${version}/Dragonfly2_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```

2. Unzip the package.

   ```sh
   # Replace `xxx` with the installation directory.
   tar -zxf Dragonfly2_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C xxx
   ```

3. Move the `manager` to your `PATH` environment variable
   to make sure you can directly use `manager` command.

Or you can build your own manager executable file.

1. Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2.git
   ```

2. Enter the project directory.

   ```sh
   cd Dragonfly2
   ```

3. Compile the source code.

   ```sh
   make build-manager && make install-manager
   ```

### Start manager

```sh
# download manager configuration example
# Notice: check and modify some config e.g. database.mysql ...
wget -o /etc/dragonfly/manager.yaml \
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/docs/en/deployment/configuration/manager.yaml

manager --options
```

After manager is installed, run the following commands to
verify if **manager** is started, and if Port `8080` and `65003` is available.

```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
telnet 127.0.0.1 65003
```

### Manager console

Now you can open brower and visit [console](http://localhost:8080)

Console features preview reference document
[console preview](../../../reference/manage-console.md).
