Installing Dragonfly CDN Server

This topic explains how to install the Dragonfly CDN server.

## Prerequisites

When deploying with physical machines, the following conditions must be met.

| Required Software | Version Limit |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Git               | 1.9.1+        |
| Golang            | 1.16.x        |
| Nginx             | 0.8+          |

## Procedure - When Deploying with Physical Machines

### Get cdn executable file

1. Download a binary package of the cdn. You can download one of
   the latest builds for Dragonfly on the
   [github releases page](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases).

   ```sh
   # latest version
   # version=$(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/version/version.latest)

   # stable version
   version=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/version/version.stable)

   wget -o Dragonfly2_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
      https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases/download/v${version}/Dragonfly2_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```

2. Unzip the package.

   ```bash
   # Replace `xxx` with the installation directory.
   tar -zxf Dragonfly2_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C xxx
   ```

3. Move the `cdn` to your `PATH` environment variable to
   make sure you can directly use `cdn` command.

Or you can build your own cdn executable file.

1. Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2.git
   ```

2. Enter the project directory.

   ```sh
   cd Dragonfly2
   ```

3. Compile the source code.

   ```sh
   make build-cdn && make install-cdn
   ```

### Start cdn

```sh
# download cdn configuration example
# Notice: check and modify some config e.g. base.manager ...
wget -o /etc/dragonfly/cdn.yaml \
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/main/docs/en/deployment/configuration/cdn.yaml

cdnHomeDir=/home/admin
cdnDownloadPort=8001
cdn --port=8003 --download-port=$cdnDownloadPort
```

### Start file server

You can start a file server in any way.
However, the following conditions must be met:

- It must be rooted at `cdnHomeDir/ftp` which is
  defined in the previous step.
- It must listen on the port `cdnDownloadPort` which is
  defined in the previous step.

Let's take nginx as an example.

1. Add the following configuration items to
   the Nginx configuration file.

   ```conf
   server {
   # Must be ${cdnDownloadPort}
   listen 8001;
     location / {
        # Must be ${cdnHomeDir}/ftp
        root /home/admin/ftp;
     }
   }
   ```

2. Start Nginx.

   ```sh
   sudo nginx
   ```

After cdn is installed, run the following commands to
verify if Nginx and **cdn** are started,
and if Port `8001` and `8003` are available.

```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 8001
telnet 127.0.0.1 8003
```
