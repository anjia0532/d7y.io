This topic explains how to install the Dragonfly scheduler server.

## Prerequisites

When deploying with physical machines, the following conditions must be met.

| Required Software | Version Limit |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Git               | 1.9.1+        |
| Golang            | 1.12.x        |
| Nginx             | 0.8+          |

## Procedure - When Deploying with Physical Machines

### Get scheduler executable file

1. Download a binary package of the scheduler.
   You can download one of the latest builds for
   Dragonfly on the [github releases page](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases).

   ```sh
   version=2.0.0
   wget https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/releases/download/v$version/Dragonfly2_$version_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```

2. Unzip the package.

   ```bash
   # Replace `xxx` with the installation directory.
   tar -zxf Dragonfly2_2.0.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C xxx
   ```

3. Move the `scheduler` to your `PATH` environment
   variable to make sure you can directly use `scheduler` command.

Or you can build your own scheduler executable file.

1. Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2.git
   ```

2. Enter the project directory.

   ```sh
   cd Dragonfly2
   ```

3. Compile the source code.

   ```sh
   make build-scheduler && make install-scheduler
   ```

### Start scheduler

```sh
scheduler --options
```

After scheduler is installed, run the following commands to
verify if **scheduler** is started, and if Port `8002` is available.

```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 8002
```
